    id: "shipping",
    question: "How long does shipping take?",
    answer:
      "Most orders ship within 5–7 business days and arrive within 7–10 days depending on your location. You'll receive tracking information as soon as your order ships. White-glove delivery is available for larger items for an additional fee.",

    id: "returns",
    question: "What is your return policy?",
    answer:
      "We offer a 30-day easy return window on most items in original condition and packaging. Start a return from your order history or contact us—we'll send a prepaid label when your piece qualifies. Some made-to-order or final-sale items are noted at checkout.",
  },
  {
    id: "assembly",
    question: "Do I need to assemble the furniture myself?",

    id: "materials",
    question: "What materials are your furniture made from?",

    id: "size",
    question: "How do I know what size will fit my space?",

  },
  {
    id: "showroom",
    question: "Can I see the furniture in person before buying?",
    answer:
      "Where we have partner showrooms or pop-ups, you'll find locations on our site. Everywhere else, high-resolution photos, fabric swatches, and our team's guidance help you decide with confidence.",
  },
  {
    id: "care",
    question: "How do I clean and maintain my furniture?",
    answer:
      "Dust regularly with a soft cloth, blot spills quickly, and follow the care guide for your finish or fabric. Avoid harsh chemicals unless specified—when in doubt, ask us before trying a new cleaner.",
  },
  {
    id: "financing",
    question: "Do you offer financing or payment plans?",
    answer:
      "Yes—eligible orders can use buy-now-pay-later or installment options at checkout where available. Terms depend on the provider and your approval.",
